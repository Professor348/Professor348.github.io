      <description>This website started as a sort of fun project to see if I could build a site using Hugo that actually looked decent. The inspiration came from Hyacinthe Cartiaux&amp;rsquo;s website, which I stumbled upon while looking for documentation on some alpha features of the game Turing Complete. This post&amp;rsquo;s purpose is to document the development of this website. as a sort of reference for me to look back on, and for other people to gain inspiration from in their own projects.</description>
