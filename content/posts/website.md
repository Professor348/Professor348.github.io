This website started as a sort of fun project to see if I could build a site using Hugo that actually looked decent. The inspiration came from [Hyacinthe Cartiaux's website](https://hcartiaux.github.io/), which I stumbled upon while looking for documentation on some alpha features of the game [Turing Complete](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1444480/Turing_Complete/).

This post's purpose is to document the development of this website. as a sort of reference for me to look back on, and for other people to gain inspiration from in their own projects.
In it, you will find links to all the resources and softwares that I used to build and host this site.
In addition, you will find some of the external learning resources that I used throughout the development of this site.
